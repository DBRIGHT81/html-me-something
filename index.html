                   <h2>Sega Nomad</h2>
                   <p>
                       In 1995, Sega attempted to re-enter 
                       the handheld gaming market a second time with the 
                       Nomad. Basically a smaller version of the Sega Genesis,
                       it was released late in it's parent's life cycle &#38;
                       doomed it to fail for Sega putting all of their focus
                       on the just released Sega 32X and Sega Saturn. Luckily
                       for me, I was able to grab one from eBay for a third of 
                       the original price. It has an extra port that lets you 
                       hook up another controller so you can play with a friend.
                       The plus side is having the ability to play almost every
                       Sega Genesis title on the go. Just make sure you have 
                       six AA batteries at your disposal.

                   <h2>NeoGeo Pocket Color</h2>
                   <p>
                       The NeoGeo Pocket Color was the last system produced by
                       Japanese gaming company SNK. It would have a relatively short 
                       lifespan of eighteen months(May 1999-October 2000), due to&#160;financial
                       woes of the company and being obliterated by its handheld 
                       competitor in Nintendo with their Pokenon francise. Despite
                       its commercial failings, it's(in my opinion) one of the best handheld systems
                       ever created. One of the main innovations of the NeoGeo Pocket&#160;Color
                       was its joystick instead of the traditional directional pad. 
                       Its short and reccessed made controlling every game feel effortless,
                       no matter the game you were playing. This one won't break the bank
                       on battteries since it only takes two AAs and are pretty easy to aquire
                       due to not being a high priority on most collectors list.

                <h2>Retrobit Super Retro Advance Adapter</h2>
                <p>
                    The Super Retro Advance by Retrobit is a neat little device
                    that allows you to play GameBoy Advance games on your&#160;Super
                    Nintendo. This thing is a life saver if you ever had issues
                    seeing the small visuals on the original GBA screen,
                    now giving the user the ability to play on larger TVs. No&#160;battery 
                    power needed here since it uses the same power of the Super Nintendo.
                    Ever wanted to play old school Castlevania on a television larger than one 
                    from your childhood? It's totally possible now with this reletivey
                    inexpensive add-on(around $35).
